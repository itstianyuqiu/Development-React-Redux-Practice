# File "PracticeToDoList.js" is a todo list, which uses some core concepts of React (useState, props, useEffect). It allows the user to create/modify/delete a todo list.Â 


## Files "PracticeContext", "PracticeReducer" and "PracticeMiniRedux" are some practices when I learn Hooks (useContext, usereEducer).


### Folder "store" and "component" is a practice when I learn Redux.
